# avr-microcontroller-projects

This repository contains a collection of embedded systems projects implemented on the ATmega328P microcontroller (Arduino Uno). 
The projects demonstrate fundamental concepts of embedded development including:

- GPIO input/output
- Interrupt-driven programming
- Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)
- UART serial communication
- Sensor integration (temperature, humidity)

Each project includes source code, circuit diagrams, and documentation.
